										<h1>A Shadow of Mediocrity</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The existence of a shadow is always tied to the entity it tries to emulate. It traces every movement, charts every primal characteristic yet fails to materialise an identity of its own. Has the shadow failed miserably because its ways and methods to emulate are short of effort? Or has it been set up for failure, since its conception, by the virtue of it being a shadow? </p>
									<p>Growing up, I was always told, rather dictated, to be a good person, to follow the rules and be obedient, at the very least, to my principles. This theme of following a hardlined set of principles, in order to achieve excellence in any measures of life was a staple, consumed at any dinner table conversation. </p>
							        <p>I have always envied people, who know what they want from their life. What they aspire to be, and become. Maybe it's the sense of directionality that I lack, or as my parents suggest, I need to find god. A god, or a set of gods (as the theology suggests) might help me with some sense of direction, or a set of directives to follow, that would help me reach my destiny. It is a comforting thought, to assume that there is a form of determinism in all of this, and a warm embrace of religious orthodoxy has never seemed so enticing. 
And, yet I fail to materialise any of it, any of the advice, any of the methods, that are supposed to help me be the ideal person I want to be, or am supposed to be. Maybe my efforts are not enough, maybe I am not consistent enough, or maybe I am too weak willed to power through any of it.
</p>
<p> “Aim to be the best version of yourself, and even if you fall short, at least you got close” is what they say, but, what they miss is that when you fail, you end up being a shadow of what you could have been. </p>
<p>Is being a shadow bad? 
One could argue that being a shadow is not a bad thing. In fact, quite a few theologians argue that we are made in the image of God. And, as a few other religious movements suggest, that maybe god resides within us, and we are but a projection of it. The form of god, inward or outward, I would like to represent, as an idealistic version of ourselves.  It could be so, that we are meant to be a shoddy version of our idealistic selves, or an incomplete outward projection, that we are to realise by looking within ourselves. And in the process of doing so, realise the idealistic version. 
But what if I fail to do that? Not in a sense that I fear failure, but rather, the version never materialises. Or what if, this is it, and there’s no amount of searching that could uncover a better version of yourself? 
</p>
<p>There could be a chance that I, or we, have set ourselves up for failure. And the idea that an ideal or a best version of ourselves exists, could be a myth. Maybe the tenets you set or the ones you were indoctrinated with, that you follow ever so religiously, are the ones that fate you to be a shadow, the inherent virtue of which, is to be tied to an identity, which is not of its own.</p>
<p>
This discourse could get very pessimistic, or even more philosophical and abstract, but its effects on the lived experiences of people are quite tangible. We are expected to be unique and assert an identity of our own, to be able to gain some social currency. And it often happens that, in the pursuit of this, we chase the ideal social construct, fall short, and inevitably become a shadow, or an appendage, that cannot materialise an identity of its own. 
I have fallen for this vice, or maybe all of us have, and we constantly feel this need to do something about this feeling of mediocrity, the feeling of being a void with no discernable identity, and the feeling of helplessness, all of it, in perpetuity. 
</p> 
<p>One can hope to break out of it, by ignoring the ideal constructs of a society, but do we have the power or ability  of choosing ourselves, our identity, over social alienation?
