									<p>It had been a laborious day; nothing out of the ordinary and largely vapid. I briskly walked out of my office gate and beelined for the supermarket, hoping to find solace in the mundaneness of adulting. As I walked down the aisles of the supermarket, shrewdly analysing my necessities versus the puerile urge to buy flashy goods, I cursed myself, yet again, for not being able to finance the wants that I had dreamed about since childhood. Although it wasn't implausible, it would be rather impractical. It is pretty funny  that the very things which enable our freedom, be it adulthood or money, also forge the shackles for it. I dragged my feet towards the billing counter and stood there, awaiting my turn and greedily eyeing the baked goods section. If there is one thing that Western gastronomy should truly pride itself in, it's their pairings of bread and cheese, my thoughts trailed. The ding of a person's successful transaction jolted me back to reality, resulting in a wave of self-loathing. It was as if my existence was a checklist of the so-called ‘deadly sins’ (shadripus). Outgrowing indoctrination truly takes a while, and even if one understands its true underpinnings, sometimes, it manifests, like a sudden itching of a scar.</p>
									<p>The gates of my hostel arrived earlier than anticipated, so an impulse overruled me, and I decided to grab a cup of tea from the dingy stall nearby. As I stood there sipping my tea, a whiff of smoke caught me off guard, and a sigh escaped my lips; the odour was very unpleasant. But the reluctance to move away was engendered by their conversation. The person had been laid off by their company today after having been benched for a week. There was a weak tremble on his lips and a numb countenance; those hollow eyes reflected a darkness that was eerily familiar. The conversation was soaked with platitudes, which personally felt caustic. I moved away slowly as a new dread had kicked in. A lonely bed felt more enticing. My conscience never hesitates to mull over the wretchedness of human existence; all it takes is a slight nudge. At times, I understand the passion for orthodoxy by the general consensus; it provides an anchor - a certainty. For uncertainty has always driven my cognition into the death spirals of philosophy.</p>
									<p>The night followed stealthily, and so did the guilt of unproductivity. I am at a stage in my life where fleeting time haunts my existence, yet it does not drive my will. A grim paradox that never escapes me. The old clock in the hallway chimed a lugubrious tune, or perhaps it was a longing, a longing for closure; a change. After all, it had witnessed a baptism of cultures and yet was immune to its own rebirth. The human race is truly fortunate, in a sense; we are capable of a renaissance - a trait that most of us take for granted. Maybe it is a renaissance that is needed to change my ways. I lay on my bed, pensive. Or is rebirth just another stone to be pushed upward a hill? My breathing slowed, a numbness struck my body as it prepared for sleep. A new day tomorrow, a new beginning, or is it another Sisyphean torment?
